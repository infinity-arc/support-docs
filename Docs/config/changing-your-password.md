## Why should you change your password?

Passwords are inconvenient, but necessary. Many people tend to avoid passwords wherever possible and are happy to use default settings or the same password for all their accounts. This behavior can make your data and your computer vulnerable to malware, hackers, or anyone who wants to play a prank on you.

## How do I make a strong password?

It is recommended to follow these guides when picking a password: 

* Your password should be:
  * At least 8 characters â€” the more characters, the better.
  * A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  * A mixture of letters and numbers.
  * Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ].
* Always avoid using obvious personal information.
* Do no reuse passwords.
