## How do I make a strong password?

It is recommended to follow these guides when picking a password: 

* Your password should be:
  * At least 8 characters â€” the more characters, the better.
  * A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  * A mixture of letters and numbers.
  * Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ].
* Always avoid using obvious personal information.
* Do no reuse passwords.
