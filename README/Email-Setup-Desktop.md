##Exchange/ActiveSync settings

On Outlook 2007 or later on Windows 7 and later, you may set up your mail as an Exchange or ActiveSync server. However, weâ€™ve found this to be more buggy than using IMAP as described above. If you encounter any problems, please use the manual settings above.

**Option** | **Value**
---------- | ---------
**Server** |	box.infinityarc.net
**Options** |	Secure Connection

Your device should also provide a contacts list and calendar that syncs to this box when you use this method.
